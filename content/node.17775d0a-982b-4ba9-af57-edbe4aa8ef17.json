We are especially interested in palliative care or end-of-life clinical trials or large observational studies. Ideally these studies are those that have been listed on clinicaltrials.gov, were IRB approved, have resulted in publication(s) in respected peer-reviewed journals and collected sufficient information to allow for secondary analyses. In order to include data in the repository, we will need to comply with your institution\u2019s data use policies and procedures.\u00a0\u00a0 Depending on your institution, this may include obtaining official authorization to share the data with the <a href=\"http:\/\/palliativecareresearch.org\/corescenters\/disc\/pcrc-data-repository\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PCRC Data Repository<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<em>(Note: we cannot include Medicare\/Medicaid claims data in the PCRC data repository.)<\/em>\r\n\r\nIf your study is chosen, you and your data analyst will be invited to attend a \u00bd day workshop in Denver on <strong>Tuesday, June 13, 2017<\/strong> to learn best practices for reproducible research and how to prepare your data for inclusion in the repository. Travel costs for you and your analyst will be covered by the PCRC. We will also award each recipient $2500 to offset costs associated with preparing the data before sending them to the repository.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/pcrc.box.com\/s\/v8kka0s08f46q5zuzfuassmoiwu0a9fs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">Please click here for Frequently Asked Questions about this funding announcement.<\/span><\/a>",
