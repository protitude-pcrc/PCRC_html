Trainees will develop mentored clinical research projects using the NIH stage model and receive experiential training through their mentors\u2019 NIH-funded clinical trials.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPlease reach out to Christine and Ana-Maria at <strong><a href=\"mailto:mghbridgethegap@mgb.org\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">mghbridgethegap@mgb.org<\/a><\/strong> for any questions.
