Informal conversations culminated in a 1\u00bd-day meeting of researchers interested in participating in the formation of a palliative care cooperative group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Possessing expertise in patient-reported outcomes, biostatistics, practice-based research networks, social work, nursing, and psychology, participants represented diverse clinical organizations, the NIH, existing cooperative groups, and international palliative care research networks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>All participants funded most of their own travel expenses; those unable to physically attend participated via teleconference. The meeting was held on the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, January 16\u201317, 2010. Its purposes were to: (1) define the structure and function of a national interdisciplinary cooperative group in palliative care research and (2) delineate an action plan for developing capacity for collaborative comparative effectiveness research in palliative care.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n",
